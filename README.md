In order to distinguish fake news from actual news, the project attempts to investigate several machine learning algorithms. For the purpose of exploring the model and identifying false news, we are comparing various classification methods and putting neural network approach to use.

â€¢	Necessary Libraries: Numpy,Pandas,Seaborn,Regex,NLTK, SKLearn,TensorFlow,Keras


Dataset:
We  used  plotifact and Snopes Data(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OcSQW1_bqahgKn5krQWY9Le8VGyY2utX/view)
1.	Load Data and Collection:For importing data we need to install necessary libray like pandas,Numpy.

2.	Data Exploring: In this part we visualize the data and extract our necessary feature.Here we merge the datasets and also concate the doc and claim.


3.	Dataset preprocessing: In this part we preprocess our merge dataset . we remove punctuation marks, remove non  Alphabetics character, Remove stopwords and lemmatization

4.	Splitting data into train and test

5.	Apply Machine learning classifiers
.Linear regression
.Deccission tree
.Random forest
.Support vector machine

6. Implemrnt  LSTM:  To run LSTM Model you need to install glove.6B.100d
         We can install glove.6B from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
     
7. Evaluating the models and comparing between classifier models.
